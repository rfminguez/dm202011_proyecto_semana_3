# Ironhack Diamond Competition
Diamond price prediction using Machine Learning for the Ironhack Data Bootcamp project #3.

The objective is to predict diamond prices using machine learning regression according to a dataset with series of characteristics.

The process of data loading, transformation, scaling and metaparameter engineering is developed in this [jupyter notebook](main.ipynb).

Best predictions achieved using the **LightGBM** algorithm.

Error metrics: RMSE
